# Question 1: Arithmetic and Comparison Operators
# Write a Python program that:

# Accepts two numbers as input from the user.
# Calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
# Checks whether:
# The first number is greater than the second.
# The first number is equal to the second.
# Prints the results for all calculations and comparisons.

# Accepting two number from user
a= int(input("Enter the first number:-  "))
b= int(input("Enter the Second number:- "))

# printing the Arithemietic operations on the two numbers
print ("Addition", a+b)
print ("Subtraction", a-b)
print ("Multiply:", a*b)
print ("Divison", a/b)


print  ("\n")

# checking whether the number 1 is greater than 2
print ("Please find the comparisons below")
print (a>b)
print (a==b)
